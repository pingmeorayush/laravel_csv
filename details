-> in the CSV data file column type 1 = Buy entry and type 2 = sell entry 

-> Read csv file from unread folder(using script No need to create ui for file upload).

-> Sorting data month and year wise.(Month Must be 3 character and year 2 character this is fixed)
	 add validation on csv data if month or year not valid then CSV read operation throw proper error message, 
	 month wise sorting not alphabetical sorting

-> on each read operation add csv_file_name entry in database (use database only for file read entry not use for profit loss script)
	 table name =  `csv_read_files fields`
	 fields =   `file_name`,`read_date_time`

-> if file is read then move to read folder,

-> Create profit loss script,(Do not use database/file/ssession for the script).

-> Print output in proper tabel. (like output.png)
